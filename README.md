# GestureFlow

GestureFlow is a lightweight library that simplifies the development of gesture-based applications using Mediapipe and OpenCV. It streamlines complex tasks like hand orientation determination, finger state recognition, and direction detection. With GestureFlow, you can easily define gestures based on parameters such as the number of raised fingers and hand rotation degree, and associate functions to be executed upon detecting these gestures.

## Gesture-Flow Based Presentation

GestureFlow offers a built-in gesture-based slide control and annotation tool tailored for presentations.

### How to Use

1. **Launch the GUI**: Run the `gui.py` file to open the GUI interface, providing clear instructions on gesture usage.

2. **Select Presentation**: Choose a loaded PowerPoint (PPT) file or load a new one by clicking "Choose File". You'll then be directed to the presentation screen.

3. **Control Presentation**: Use gestures to navigate slides, annotate content, erase annotations, and adjust pointer and eraser sizes.

5. **Customize Gestures**: In the settings page, customize gestures by clicking the camera icon. This opens a capture window where you perform your custom gesture with one hand (or two for multi-handed gestures), then click capture to set the gesture for the selected action.

6. **Reset Gestures**: After adding custom gestures, a reset button appears at the bottom left corner of the settings screen. Click it to revert gestures to their initial state, removing all customizations.
